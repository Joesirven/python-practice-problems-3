# Create a fxn named “count_first_letter” that takes in one parameter: a dictionary with a last name as a key and a list of first names as the value. The fxn should return a dictionary where each key is the first letter of the last name and the value is the number of people whose last name begins with that letter.

# Input: ({‘Stark’: [‘Ned’, ‘Robb’, ‘Sansa], ‘Snow’: [‘Jon’], ‘Lannister’: [‘Jaime’, ‘Cersei’, ‘Tywin’]}) Output: {‘S’: 4, ‘L’: 3}
