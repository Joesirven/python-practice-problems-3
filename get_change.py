# Create a fxn named “get_change” that gets user input for a cash total. Calculate the total number of Quarters / Dimes / Nickels / Pennies for the change exchange. The fxn should return a print of those calculations.
# Note: make this a “hungry” fxn that gets the largest number of large coins and smallest number of small coins.
# Note: validate the input to ensure proper input from the user, cover all edge case entries, do not allow breaking errors

# Input: 1.49
# Output:
# Total Cents: 149
# Total Quarters: 5
# Total Dimes: 2
# Total Nickels: 0
# Total Pennies: 4
